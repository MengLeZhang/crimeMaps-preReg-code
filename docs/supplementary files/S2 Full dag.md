## A2. Full DAG

Additional variables are:

- $I$ represent entire information sets/ datasets with a subscript denoting different information.
  - $I_s$ is the secret list of snap-points used by police.uk. We know how $I_s$ was constructed (see data section).
  - $I_c$ represents crimes, where they occur and crime type. The level of crimes around a house (summarised by $C_r$) affects house prices in various ways (e.g. property destruction).
  - $I_h$ represents houses and their characteristics, including their location.

Other variables retain the same meaning.
