Reviewer's Responses to Questions

Comments to the Author

1. Does the manuscript provide a valid rationale for the proposed study, with clearly identified and justified research questions?

> The research question outlined is expected to address a valid academic problem or topic and contribute to the base of knowledge in the field.

Reviewer #1: Yes

Reviewer #2: No

2. Is the protocol technically sound and planned in a manner that will lead to a meaningful outcome and allow testing the stated hypotheses?

> The manuscript should describe the methods in sufficient detail to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedure or analysis pipeline, including sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. necessary controls, absence of floor or ceiling effects) to test the proposed hypotheses and a statistical power analysis where applicable. As there may be aspects of the methodology and analysis which can only be refined once the work is undertaken, authors should outline potential assumptions and explicitly describe what aspects of the proposed analyses, if any, are exploratory.

Reviewer #1: Yes

Reviewer #2: No

3. Is the methodology feasible and described in sufficient detail to allow the work to be replicable?

> Descriptions of methods and materials in the protocol should be reported in sufficient detail for another researcher to reproduce all experiments and analyses. The protocol should describe the appropriate controls, sample size calculations, and replication needed to ensure that the data are robust and reproducible.

Reviewer #1: Yes

Reviewer #2: No

4. Have the authors described where all data underlying the findings will be made available when the study is complete?

> The PLOS Data policy requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception, at the time of publication. The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.

Reviewer #1: Yes

Reviewer #2: Yes

5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?

> PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.

Reviewer #1: Yes

Reviewer #2: Yes

6. Review Comments to the Author

> Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above and, if applicable, provide comments about issues authors must address before this protocol can be accepted for publication. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about research or publication ethics.

> You may also provide optional suggestions and comments to authors that they might find helpful in planning their study.

Reviewer #1: I find the text a bit repetitive. Try to remove some ideas that are mentioned twice.

Page 16. In general, confounders are not properly defined. This is unclear.
Page 16. The definition of "I" and three types of "I" is unclear. How is this used later in the text?
Page 20. The text mentions Figure 5, which is not located in the main text.
Page 22. "share" should be "shared"
Table 1 column headings should be checked (Ln vs. Log)?
Table 1 should contain currency (the reader assumes this is GBP, right?).

The bibliography list is not homgeneous. The authors should mention how to cope with the risk of finding errors in the data, having solid data for such a project is not only related the presence of missing data.
The quality of preparation of this manuscript should increase.

Reviewer #2: The present paper gives an estimation of the causal effect of public crime maps on house prices. Based on the public crime map website www.police.uk , the authors conducted an experiment where the main objective is to specify the research plan ahead of data collection/Access and tried to answer two main questions: 1) Did police.uk crime statistics affect property prices? and 2) what is the effect of a one-unit increase in crime around a house (as reported by crime maps) on its selling price?

Whereas I find the results useful, the paper is very flawed in its structure, groundwork such as literature and data referencing and lacks a discussion section completely. It does not fulfil the format required by the journal, I think that the authors have disregarded the formal requirements and guidelines of the PLoS ONE journal. The manuscript organization is a bit confusing, for instance, sections are unnumbered, data sources appear at the end, the results section is located in the supplementary material and the findings and conclusions/discussions are missed. I suggest a section with a main heading and subsections up to 2-3 heading levels.

Below I give a (non-exhaustive) list of limitations of the paper, by section

1) Background

1.1. The research questions are clear however the authors mention that the early results are in the supplementary materials. Why?

1.2. Also, is hard to understand the meaning of the sentence: “If data access is granted before this protocol is finalised, we will stop any house price data (i.e. outcomes) from being analysed alongside the police force data.”

1.3. The authors state that RQ1 was answered by serendipitous discovery. What is the meaning of this?

2) Previous studies

2.1. Please stick to the correct reference style, even for data references and web pages.

2.2. The literature work is a bit sloppy and scarce. The authors state that: “no other study has studied the effect of crime maps on house prices or leveraged the type of design developed in this study.” However, other works that have studied the effect of crime maps on house prices and not referenced are, for instance:

- Wilhelmsson, M., & Ceccato, V. (2015). Does burglary affect property prices in a nonmetropolitan municipality? Journal of Rural Studies, 39, 210–218.

3) Hypothesis

3.1. H1 is the hypothesis rejected by the serendipitous Discovery, whereas the authors state that H2 hypothesis has not been tested yet because they do not have extracted the data. If so, RQ2 remains unanswered and the research only has one research question. Please, clarify this.

3.2. Again, please stick to the correct reference style, even for data references and web pages

4) Research Design

4.1. What did the authors mean when they refer to “confounding (common causes)”?
4.2. Figure 2 is a bit confusing as estimated BetaT is an estimated parameter grouping several associations as correlation coefficient, regression slope, etc…

5) Methodology and Statistical Analysis

5.1. Please state more clearly, which period and periodicity are covered by your data. Is a bit confusing to understand which years are the data covering especially after reading the section Sample.
5.2. In the manuscript, there are continuous references to the supplementary material however none of these references are accurate, i.e. A1, A2, A3,…
5.3. Has been multicollinearity checked? The DAG resulting in the supplementary material reveals causal relations that may produce a correlation between independent variables.

6) Estimator RQ1

6.1. To check the results we had to move to the supplementary material.
6.2. Are the results statistically significant?

7) Estimator RQ2

7.1. Apparently, there are no results for Research Question 2. Neither in the manuscript nor in the supplementary material. If there is no outcomes, what is the point to include the RQ2? Please, clarify this.

8) Sensitivity and Robustness tests

8.1. Which tests for sensitivity and robustness did the authors applied?

9) Data sources

9.1. The authors mention a kitchen-sink approach for the impact of the confounders the role of the variable might be different: categorical, ordinal, quantitative, qualitative,… how did they deal with all of them?

It would have been interesting to determine what is the type of crime that most affects prices (vandalism, burglary, robbery, violent crime, etc…) even the kind of predominant population in the area, whether the…?
I completely miss a discussion of the main findings that goes deeper on what we learned from the paper regarding whether crime maps have an impact on house prices moreover since RQ2 has not been answered.

Overall, I think the results could be useful for further analysis. The paper, however, in its current form reads more like a (rather unstructured) analysis of the relationship between crime maps and house prices than an original study protocol. Conclusions are not presented in an appropriate fashion and the paper would need serious restructuring. In the current form, it is not acceptable for publication in this journal.
