__Acknowledgements__

We thank Jamie Smith from South Yorkshire Police for helping us gain access to the data and addressing our numerous questions about the police data. We also thank Alberto Hidalgo for his comments and feedback on this protocol. We thank our colleague, Kitty Lymperopoulou, who collaborated with us on an earlier scoping project that eventually led to this study. We are indebted to her for her time. We contacted Lisa Tompson for statistics from her paper to do power size calculations before this project and its pilot began. We are grateful for her help.  This protocol uses data from OpenStreetMap (Â© OpenStreetMap contributors).

__Funding__

This project is funded by a British Academy/ Leverhulme small grant (SRG21\210192).

__Code source__

Our code for the protocol is included as part of the submission. The data comes from public domain sources. We have also put our code up on a public Github repo: https://github.com/MengLeZhang/crimeMaps-preReg-code
